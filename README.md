# Beer Here
This is our first project as part of a Web Development Bootcamp. Users can enter a city and state and find breweries near them. The page will return the names, addresses, phone numbers and ratings for breweries. The breweries are sorted by google rating before being added to the page. 

## Front-End Framework:
* Materialize

## Server-Side APIs:
* Open Brewery DB
* Google Places API

## Third Party APIs:
* Google Maps Javascript API
* Jquery

## Our Team
* Heidi - Front-End and Materialize expert
* Keeley - Server-side APIs
* Mel - Google Maps Javascript

## Future Improvements
1. Speed up the return of results to the page
2. Add Website to returned results
3. Improved error handling and verification of data.
